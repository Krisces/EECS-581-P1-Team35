Battleship Game
This program implements a two-player Battleship game with manual ship placement. Players take turns firing
shots at each other's board, and the first player to sink all the opponent's ships wins.
Inputs: Player inputs for placing ships and firing shots
Output: Hits, misses, ship status (sunk or not)
